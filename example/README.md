# Go TUI Learning Repository

This repository is a space for experimenting with and learning about building Terminal User Interfaces (TUIs) in Go.

The primary focus is on using the [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework and other related components from [Charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet).

The goal is to deepen understanding of both TUI development and the Go programming language in general.
